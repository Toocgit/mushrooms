# mushrooms
I completed a Machine Learning project where I built a classifier to classify mushrooms as poisonous or edible.
By executing a logistic regression model including gradient descent, the program learns to accurately classify 99% of training data mushrooms and 98% of testing data mushrooms.
Highlights:
-	Feature engineering, converting categorical features to numeric indicator features
-	Function definitions for the logistic regression model
-	Interesting observation in that varying the number of gradient descent steps or the learning rate, has an impact on which five features are most significant to an edible or poisonous classification
